# OCCStatsTracker
OCC does not have persistent stats tracking or leveling.  
Because of that i created a mod to do it locally.  

-------------------------  
Usage and install:  
Requires minecraft forge 1.8.9  
Full compatibility with oc.tc and partial compatibility with warz.one  

/sessionstats - shows your stats in your current session (since you opened minecraft)  
/lifetimestats - shows your lifetime stats  

/togglexpleveling - toggle the optional feature that creates a level tracking system. Off by default  
/togglexpmessages - toggles the xp gained messages  
/togglexpbar - toggles the feature that changes the XP bar to show your OCCStatsTracker leveling level.  

/togglekillstreak - toggles the killstreak and killstreak lost messages. On by default.  

-------------------------  


Update - Since OCC added stat tracking this is now obsolete
