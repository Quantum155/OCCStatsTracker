# OCCStatsTracker
OCC does not have persistent stats tracking or leveling.
Because of that i created a mod to do it locally.

-------------------------
Usage and install:
Requires minecraft forge 1.8.9
Full compatibility with oc.tc and partial compatibility with warz.one
Put the downloaded .jar file in your .minecraft/mods folder

/sessionstats - shows your stats in your current session (since you opened minecraft)
/lifetimestats - shows your lifetime stats

/togglexpleveling - toggle the optional feature that creates a level tracking system. Off by default
/togglexpmessages - toggles the xp gained messages
/togglexpbar - toggles the feature that changes the XP bar to show your OCCStatsTracker leveling level.

/togglekillstreak - toggles the killstreak and killstreak lost messages. On by default.

-------------------------
Notes to anyone who want to make the mistake of looking at the source code:
I'm very bad at Java. In fact i don't even know Java. I'm just using my experience from other languages to make something that works.
